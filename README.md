## Who am I?

Currently, I'm a freshman in college pursuing computer engineering. I generally create projects that solve problems I am
facing, such as a practice website for my high school Science Olympiad event in React or a tool to transfer data between
Windows and iOS in Python. I've also written code for my high school Robotics team in Java and C# and have taught basic
Python skills to team members.
