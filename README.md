## Who am I?

Currently, I'm a senior in high school hoping to pursue computer engineering in college. I'm on the programming group on
my FRC robotics team, where I have helped to program the competition robot in Java as well as an outreach robot in C#.
I'm also an assistant lead and am in charge of the Python subgroup. My role consists of teaching group members Python
skills and tools as well as overseeing projects involving Python. Outside of robotics, I'm working on Kivy Cupertino, a
Python package I've been developing for almost two years now.
